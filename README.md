# TRACE
Trace is a University of Tennessee digital archive that showcases and preserves published and unpublished works by faculty, departments, programs, research ...

What is the Institutional Repository Project?

The Libraries is currently investigating open source IR systems with the intention to select and implement a new institutional repository platform to replace the hosted Bepress Digtial Commons instance of Trace.

The TRACE project in github is a virtual platform for the DI programmers to investigate the most effective solutions for the IR Project.  

This virtual platform should support
 * Creation of a migration plan
 * Determination of hardware requirements
 * An agile software development environment
 * A secure testing environment
 * The ability to demonstrate the look and behavior of the site to our peers outside of the DI programming group
